- Add -tt option for time-triggered activities in pipeline
  (as opposed to push-triggered).
- Cleanup unused code in Controller and derivate classes
x Return b_k in XX::calcBandwidth(), instead of u_k

x Rename from Scheduler to Controller
x Check situation evolves badly after a while and b_k goes down
x Check negative c_k i.e. time goes backward in task0.dat

x Check -T option: catched in multiple places ==> if given too early,
  simulation does not work.
