<h1>Adaptive Reservation Simulator (ARSim)</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
<tt>ARSim</tt> emulates multiple reservation-based schedulers, where each job
of each task, with unpredictable duration, is dynamically assigned a
bandwidth controlled by a QoS module. In the second release of the
emulator, it is possible to instantiate more tasks, each one
controlled by its own controller, and the statistics are collected on
a temporal-average basis, rather than on the job-end event-based
fashion used in the first release.

<p>
Supports various kind of QoS controllers (which have been properly
renamed to Controllers w.r.t. to the previous release), task types and
task predictor. Also, there is a single GlobalController which
enforces the global saturation constraint by means of a simple
recompression policy, but other global controllers may be added, by
subclassing the GlobalController class.

<p>
A QoS Controller is a module that decides, each time a job finishes,
what bandwidth must be allocated for the next job execution. Decision
is made differently by various controller types. Some of them rely on
the prediction of the next execution time (mean value, standard
deviation, interval in which sample will fall with high prob), that is
performed by a TaskPredictor module. Task behaviour is emulated by a
Task module, that generates job execution times.  QoS Controller, Task
and Task Predictor types can be changed, and parameters can be fed to
them, by using proper command line options.

<p>
The program executable is <tt>arsim</tt>, and it is able to simulate the
asynchronous execution of multiple tasks running on multiple resources.
Each new resource but the first one is introduced by a '-r' option.
Tasks have unique zero-based IDs within the resource they consume. Resources
have zero-based IDs as well. During an execution run, the program produces
various files (? is a pair of comma separated numbers identifying a task
by means of its own task ID and resource ID):

<ul>
  <li> <bf>task?.dat</bf>: a table for each task suitable for feeding gnuplot
    <tt>plot</tt> command. Common output columns are: time, instantaneous
    budget, number of enqueued jobs, required and assigned bandwidth,
    last scheduling error measurement.

  <li> <bf>rbw_stat?.dat</bf>: the required bandwidth PDF for each task

  <li> <bf>bw_stat?.dat</bf>: the assigned bandwidth PDF for each task
</ul>

<p>
More specifically, apart from what is randomly written on stdout, the
program creates a huge number of "*_stat*,*.dat" files within the
current folder. This is the main result of the simulation (all files
have a suffix of the type <task-ID>,<resource-ID>.dat).

<p>
The <tt>task*.dat</tt> files contain the temporal evolution of the simulation,
 with such columns as:<ul>
 <li> time: current simulation time
 <li> T: task period (always the same)
 <li> N_k: number of enqueued jobs
 <li> c_k: residual budget for the currently executing job (starts from the
   job computation time requirement, and goes down to zero)
 <li> b_k: currently assigned bandwidth (as from the supervisor)
 <li> rb_k: currently required bandwidth (as from the task controller)
 <li> e_k: last measured scheduling error (absolute value, i.e. same
   measurement unit as the task period (T) or execution time (c_k)
   columns)
 <li> pl_n, pl_p: pipeline structure: list of tasks that depend on this (pl_n),
   or that this depends on (pl_p), in the form <task-ID>,<resource-ID>
   (this info is always the same in the file)
</ul>

<p>
The <tt>*_stats*.dat</tt> files contain various statistics on the simulation.
 Each file has a one-line quick description of the statistic, plus a few
 summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max and mean
 of non-zero samples) in the first commented 3 lines. The files are as follows:
<ul>
 <li> bw_stats: PDF of the "bw" column
 <li> rbw_stats: PDF of the "rbw" column
 <li> ck_stats: PDF of the execution time (does not correspond to the PDF
   of the c_k column, because the latter also represents residual budget
   as it evolves in time).
 <li> se_stats: PDF of the scheduling error values, collected at the end of
   each job (does not correspond to the distribution of the e_k column);
   the collected values are also output in "se<task-ID>,<resource-ID>.dat"
   files
 <li> pred: time evolution of the predicted value (m_k column) and range(s)
   (h_k, H_k and hi_k, Hi_k) as output, respectively, by the value and
   range predictors
 <li> rw_stats: PDF of prediction range width (represents the accuracy of
   the range predictor)
 <li> pr_stats: PMF of the range prediction being correct (value 1), or not (0).
 <li> ra_stats: PDF of the predicted range "alpha" value (h_k / H_k ratio)
</ul>

<p>
Moreover, there are some invariant-specific stats:
<ul>
 <li> pi_stats: PMF (Mass Function) of the scheduling error staying into the
   invariant (value 1), or not (value 0).
 <li> pii_stats: same for the internal invariant, if has been used
 <li> ri_stats: PMF of the number of steps required for the scheduling error
   to return back into the invariant once exited it.
</ul>

<p>
Please, note that in the stats files values are all normalized to the task
period (T column), so "1.0" represents actually the value "T" (e.g. 40 msec
for the usual MPEG samples we use).

<p>
You can easily plot the represented data with GNUplot scripts. 


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Octave library (liboctave), for class 'TPOptimumLinearFIR'.
  <li> GNU GLPK Toolkit, for class 'GlobalController'.
</ul>

<h2>Compile</h2>

<p>
Just type 'make'.


<h2>Use</h2>

<tt>./arsim [options]</tt>

Note:
<ul>
  <li> <tt>arsim</tt> specific options must follow scheduler specification
  <li> Task specific options must follow task specification
  <li> Mostly useful options may be customized through command line options
  and arguments. Though, defaults.h contains the default values for
  many of these options whenever they are not specified on the command line.
</ul>

<p>
List of supported options:
<tt>./<tt>arsim</tt> [-h|--help]</tt>

<p>
Each '-s' option adds a QoS controller, which must be assigned a task
type with a subsequent '-t' option, and may be assigned a task
predictor with the '-tp' option. All subsequent options, up to the
next '-s' option, feed parameters to the just added controller, task
type, or task predictor. All of the introduced tasks and controllers
refer to the same resource, unless a '-r' option is used, which
introduced the definition of a new resource, so that all of the
subsequent controller and task definitions refer to the new created
resource. Dependencies among tasks may be specified through the '-pa'
(Pipe After) and '-pb' (Pipe Before) options within a task definition,
which take as argument a pair of comma separated IDs identifying a
specific task into a specific resource (taskID,resourceID).
